title: Welcome to TiddlyWiki's Documentation

This is an attempt by @ldorigo to make TiddlyWiki's code (and documentation) more accessible to newcomers.

My goals are two:

* Unify what's already present into a more uniform documentation, improving accessibility (some tiddlers are currently only accessible by search) and removing duplicate information

* Create a "step-by-step" tutorial that explains the source code, from boot to plugins.
** Ideally, map each source code file to a corresponding tiddler on this wiki, which will contain detailed information on that file's functionality
