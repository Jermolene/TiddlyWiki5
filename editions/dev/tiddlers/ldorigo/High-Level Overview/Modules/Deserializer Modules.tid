title: Deserializer Modules

Modules with ``module-type: tiddlerdeserializer`` provide functions to create tiddlers out of textual representation. 

Each function must be associated with a type like ``application/json`` or ``text/html``. It takes as arguments the textual representation of the tiddlers, some default field values and the type of the text block.
It then returns an array of ~JavaScript objects representing the resulting tiddlers.

Deserializers are not managed by the [[Syncer]]: they are actually part of the [[Microkernel]].

This is necessary because the microkernel needs a way of loading tiddlers //before// it can load the [[Core Plugin]] and execute its startup modules. (Since the core plugin is a tiddler itself, it couldn't work otherwise)


The ``load-modules`` [[startup module|Startup Modules]] loads additional deserializers and pushes them into the store.
The core plugin for example contains a few deserializers which can read a whole ~TiddlyWiki5 or classic HTML file and load the individual tiddlers into the store.
