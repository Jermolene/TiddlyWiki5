title: Syncadaptor Modules
toc-order: 5


Syncadaptor modules encapsulate storage mechanisms that can be used by the [[Syncer]]. Two examples are:

* The ~TiddlyWeb Adaptor which interfaces with servers compatible with ~TiddlyWeb's HTTP API, such as ~TiddlyWeb itself and ~TiddlyWiki5's built-in server mechanism.

* The local file adaptor which interfaces with file systems with an API compatible with Node.js's `fs` module

Syncadaptor modules are represented as ~JavaScript tiddlers with the field `module-type` set to `syncadaptor`.

The `adaptorClass` property should be exposed via the `exports` object. It must contain the ~JavaScript class for the adaptor (see [[Adaptor Class]]).

Nothing should be exported if the adaptor detects that it isn't capable of operating successfully (eg, because it only runs on either the browser or the server, or because a dependency is missing).
