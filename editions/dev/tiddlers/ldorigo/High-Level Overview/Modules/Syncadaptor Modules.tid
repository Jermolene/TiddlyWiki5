title: Syncadaptor Modules
toc-order: 5


Syncadaptor Modules encapsulate storage mechanisms that can be used by the SyncMechanism. Two examples are:

* The TiddlyWebAdaptor which interfaces with servers compatible with TiddlyWeb's HTTP API, such as TiddlyWeb itself and TiddlyWiki5's built-in ServerMechanism.

* The LocalFileAdaptor which interfaces with file systems with an API compatible with Node.js's `fs` module

SyncAdaptorModules are represented as JavaScript tiddlers with the field `module-type` set to `syncadaptor`.

The `adaptorClass` property should be exposed via the `exports` object. It must contain the JavaScript class for the adaptor (see [[Adaptor Class]]).

Nothing should be exported if the adaptor detects that it isn't capable of operating successfully (eg, because it only runs on either the browser or the server, or because a dependency is missing).
