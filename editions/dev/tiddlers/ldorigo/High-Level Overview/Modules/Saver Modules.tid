title: Saver Modules
toc-order: 3

Modules with ``module-type: saver`` provide functionality to save the whole wiki. There are three methods a saver can support:

* ''save'':  used when the user explicitely requests a save, for example by clicking the save button in the sidebar.

* ''autosave'': This method is used automatically by TW when tiddlers are changed, created or deleted by the user.

* ''download'': used when the wiki or a single tiddler should explicitly be downloaded. The control panel for example uses this method to provide a button which saves the wiki as a static HTML file.

A saver module has to export two functions:

# ``canSave(wiki)`` returning true if this module can be used in the current environment
# ``create(wiki)`` returning an instance of a saver object

This saver object has to provide an ``info`` property containing a name, a priority, an array of methods it supports and a method ``save(text,method,callback)``. This method is called from TW with the actual text which should be saved, the method which is used and a callback function to report errors: ``callback("Error while saving")`` or to notify that saving went well: ``callback(null, "Saving went well :)")``. If the saver method successfully saved the file it has to return true, and false otherwise.

Saves are triggered by [[messages|Messages]] from the UI. The [[Syncer Module]] uses the saver with the highest priority capable of the requested method to save the file.

The core plug-in contains a saver capable of saving the current state of the wiki to the local hard drive by using a special Firefox extension called Tiddlyfox. If this extension is not available, the savers ``canSave`` method would return false. A saver with a lower priority would then ask the user to save the current state as a new HTML file.
