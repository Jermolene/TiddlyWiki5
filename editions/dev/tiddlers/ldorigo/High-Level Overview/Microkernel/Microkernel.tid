title: Microkernel



The ~TiddlyWiki application is based on a microkernel architecture, that means it separates its minimal functional core from the extended functionality provided by plugins and modules. The microkernel is responsible for starting up the application. It provides a few helper methods but its main task is to give the possibility of storing data and loading plugins.

The microkernel is the only part of ~TiddlyWiki that is //not// managed as tiddlers.
