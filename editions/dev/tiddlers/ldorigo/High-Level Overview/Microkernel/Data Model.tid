title: Data Model

The micro-kernel creates a ~TiddlyWiki specific data-structure called tiddler. 

Careful: In the architectural view, a tiddler is a ~JavaScript object holding some data. In the overall context a tiddler is similar to a wiki page in a wiki application like wikipedia. What is described here is the architectural view of a tiddler. 

```javascript
{"fields":{
   "text":"example Text",
   "title":"Infrastruktur",
   "tags":["vs"],
   "modified":"2014-07-01T16:25:01.230Z",
   "myField":"myFieldValue",
   "created":"2014-07-01T16:22:10.673Z"
   }
}
```

The snippet above shows the JSON representation of a tiddler object. During the runtime of ~TiddlyWiki everything is saved in an object like this. Without the proper plug-in, data is not persistent: all the data is kept in a store, which is a javascript object, in memory. 

The store has a Map structure with a bunch of key-value pairs. Each tiddler has its name as key in the map and the ~JavaScript object as value. 

The //Tiddler// is the main datastructure within ~TiddlyWiki, everything from data up to plug-ins is stored as a tiddler.
