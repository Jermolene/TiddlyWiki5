title: Event Mechanism


TODO: Rewrite this when I have a better understanding of it, quite unclear as of now.

Most of the mechanisms in this section need a way to get notified, when anything in the wiki store changes.
The [[Core Plugin]] adds an event system to the bare wiki store.

The event system provides the ability to listen for events, the most important of which is the //change// event which notifies listeners when tiddlers have changed, with a list of the modified tiddlers.

The event mechanism is one of the few mechanisms that needs a [[Hook|Hooks]] in the [[Microkernel]]: the microkernel contains an empty function `enqueueTiddlerEvent(event)` and calls this function when a tiddler is added or deleted.
The event mechanism from the core plug-in overwrites this function with it's own implementation.
The functions composing the event system are added via [[Wikimethod Modules]].
