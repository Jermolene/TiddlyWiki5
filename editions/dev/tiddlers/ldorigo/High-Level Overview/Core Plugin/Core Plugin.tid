title: Core Plugin

The [[Microkernel]] builds up the base functionality to manage tiddlers by providing a basic wiki store and a barebone tiddler model.
The microkernel can also load a set of (decrypted) tiddlers and provides a [[Module]] system, enabling a developer to extend the kernel and add functionality with module tiddlers and [[Plugin]]s.

The TiddlyWiki Core Application is provided as a single plugin which is the focus of this section.
