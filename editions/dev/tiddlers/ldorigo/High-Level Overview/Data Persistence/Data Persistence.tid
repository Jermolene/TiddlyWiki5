title: Data Persistence

TiddlyWiki provides many ways to save (persist) data. They fall into two broad categories: [[Savers and Deserializers]], at the wiki level, and [[Syncadaptors]] at the tiddler level.


While the microkernel contains a bare store and some deserializers to load tiddlers from JSON files or from the DOM of the current HTML file, the core plug-in adds some more deserializers and a mechanism for persisting and synchronising tiddlers: the [[Syncer]].
