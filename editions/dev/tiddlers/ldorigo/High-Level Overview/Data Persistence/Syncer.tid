The Syncer mechanism is provided as a global module in [[$:/core/modules/syncer.js]].
The Syncer module has three responsibilities:

# Save the whole wiki.
# Provide the ability to download single tiddlers as files.
# Synchronise the local wiki store with a remote wiki store, i.e. running in Node.js

The syncer module is connected mainly to two other modules.
For one it registers to changes at the wiki store ([[Event Mechanism]]) and if any changes occur they are synced to the remote store.
Then it provides a function ``saveWiki(options)``. This function can be used by other modules. For example the [[RootWidget|Root Widget and Rendering Startup]] uses this function to save the whole wiki or start downloading single tiddlers.

The syncer itself does not provide a concrete implementation of saving, downloading or syncing the tiddlers.
Instead it loads modules of type ``saver`` and ``syncadaptor`` and manages the saving/syncing process.
