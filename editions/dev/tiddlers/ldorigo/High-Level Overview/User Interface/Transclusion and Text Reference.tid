title: Transclusion and Text Reference

This section describes how transclusion and Text References are handled by TiddlyWiki.

!!! ~TextReference
A text reference describes a special notation to indirectly refer to the contents of a specified tiddler field.
The syntax of a text reference is:

```
<tiddlertitle>
<tiddlertitle>!!<fieldname>
!!<fieldname> - specifies a field of the current tiddlers
```

To obtain the actual text, the [[Core Plugin]] adds a function to the wiki store ``getTextReference(textRef,defaultText,currTiddlerTitle)``. The `currentTiddlerTitle` is the title of a tiddler which is used when no tiddlerTitle is specified in the text reference.
What the currentTiddler should be, depends on where the text reference is used.
If it is for example used as a widget attribute, the current tiddler is the tiddler which contains this widget.
Text references are used by [[Widget]]s (attributes), filteroperators (parameter) and in transclusions.
These elements use the ``getTextReference(textRef,defaultText,currTiddlerTitle)`` function.

!!! Transclusion

Transclusion means including the contents of a different tiddler.
This is realized with a transclude widget which parses the tiddler to be included and adds the resulting nodes as children of its own parse node.
The trick with transclusion is, that it shows the content of a different tiddler but by default it does not change the current tiddler.
This enables us to create tiddlers with text references and use them as a templates.

For example:
Tiddler ``MyTask`` having the fields and the content of:

```
important: "very"
assoc.person: "Hans Dampf"

<$transclude tiddler="TaskHeaderTemplate" />

Hans needs some more Dampf.
```

And Tiddler ``TaskHeaderTemplate`` with a content of:

```
<$view field="assoc.person"/> has a <$view field="important"/> important task for us:
```

When showing tiddler ``MyTask`` it would result in:

```
Hans Dampf has a very important task for us:

Hans needs some more Dampf.
```

Transclusion and templates is one of the most important concepts in TiddlyWiki.
It allows us to include other tiddlers using the metadata for our current tiddler.
It also allows us to transclude a template tiddler with a third tiddler set as the currentTiddler with the ~TiddlerWidget:

```
<$tiddler tiddler="MyTiddler">
<$transclude tiddler="EditTemplate" />
</$tiddler>
```

This way we can create a different view on a tiddler which does not only show it's title and it's content
but shows it's content and metadata in editable text fields and allows us to edit this tiddler.
Also the template concept is used by the ~ListWidget to show the tiddlers through a specified template.
Finally, when wanting to download the wiki as a new html file, this html file is created by binding a list of all tiddlers to a template and sending the resulting text to the syncer module described in [[Extended Persistence]] to save the current wiki.
