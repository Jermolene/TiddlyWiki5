title: Messages

Messages are events that are triggered by the user. They are generated by widgets for example when the user clicks on a [[Button Widget]].
Each message has a type property like "tm-delete-tiddler" and a parameter.

```js
{
    type: "tm-delete-tiddler", 
    param: "MyOldTiddler"
}
```

After such a message is created by a [[Widget|Widgets]], it is sent to its parent widget which sends it to its own parent widget and so on.

On the way, each widget can try to dispatch the message.
This functionality is provided by the base widget object.
It provides a function ``dispatchEvent(message)`` which is called by the children to bubble the message up the widget tree.
Another function ``addEventListener(type,listener)`` can be used to bind a function to a specific message type.
If the listener returns false, the message is send to the parent widget.

The TiddlyWiki [[Core Plugin]] handles a lot of messages in the [[Navigator Widget|RootWidget and Rendering Startup]].
