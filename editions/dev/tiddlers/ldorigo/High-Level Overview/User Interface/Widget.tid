Once the WikiText has been transformed into a parse tree by the [[Parser]], the next step is to transform this parse tree into a widget tree by transforming each node into a widget object.

The [[Core Plugin]] provides a basic [[widget object|Widget Class]] which receives the parse node it should represent and a DOM node. The widget must then create the DOM structure which represents the parse tree node and add it to the provided DOM node.
A LinkWidget, for example, would create the DOM node for a ``<a>...</a>`` tag and put it in the provided DOM node.

When a widget gets a parse node with child nodes it must create the corresponding child widgets.

All this functionality provided with the base widget. But when creating the widget for a parse node it loads additional [[modules|Widget Modules]] with ``module-type: widget``. These modules can export multiple widgets which extend the base widget and can override its methods such as the ones responsible for rendering and refreshing.

As described in [[Parser]] each parse node contains a "type" property. This type directly determines which widget module is used.


Example: 

```js
{
    type: "text", 
    text: <string>
} - a text node
```

Would be transformed to a [[TextWidget|$:/core/modules/widgets/text.js]].
(Note that the ~TextWidget module exports a property "text".)

TODO: Next line is confusing
This means that widgets in WikiText are not actually a feature added to WikiText but instead a specific widget used directly, instead of the parser choosing a widget type.

The [[Introduction]] mentions how dynamic behaviour can be added by widgets. This is achieved in two ways: [[Messages]] and [[Selective Update]].
