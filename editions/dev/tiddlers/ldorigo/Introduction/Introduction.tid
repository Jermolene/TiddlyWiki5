title: Introduction

The goal of this section is to give a very broad overview of ~TiddlyWiki's internal architecture.

~TiddlyWiki is a personal notebook application inspired by wikis.
It's built as a one-page application, meaning the whole app is delivered in <<.em one>> html file which contains source code to dynamically change the view and behaviour of the application and its data. 
Nothing has to be loaded at runtime: the html file contains everything needed to start and run the app. 

For more details, see [[TiddlyWiki as Single Page Application]].

~TiddlyWiki is highly customisable because of a very sophisticated [[Modules and Plugins]] system. Except for the [[Microkernel]] written in ~JavaScript, the whole application is built from a datastructure called [[Tiddler|Tiddler as Basic Element]] and a markup language called [[WikiText|WikiText Markup]].

Modules and plugins are all implemented as tiddlers.
