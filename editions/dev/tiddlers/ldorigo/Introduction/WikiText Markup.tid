title: WikiText Markup

The ~WikiText is a markup language, created especially for the requirements of the ~TiddlyWiki application. It is based on [[Markdown|http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown]], 
but extended with some ~TiddlyWiki-specific features.  
On one hand its a text-to-HTML conversion language and on the other hand its used to provide the interactive features of ~TiddlyWiki.
Its aim is to allow ~TiddlyWiki's users to focus on the writing. 

The tags of the ~WikiText syntax can be used within the standard text input field. 
During the saving process, these tags render to HTML elements. For example:

```
--- 
```
Renders as:

---

(HTML `<hr>`)


```
[img[https://tiddlywiki.com/favicon.ico]]
```

Renders as: 

[img[https://tiddlywiki.com/favicon.ico]]

(HTML: `<img src="https://tiddlywiki.com/favicon.ico">`)

Furthermore ~WikiText is used to access [[Widgets]] which are used to enhance ~WikiText with rich functionality. Widgets are based on ~HTML-Syntax but always start with a `$`:

```
WikiText:
<$button message="tm-close-tiddler">Close Me!</$button> 
```

Renders as:

<$button message="tm-close-tiddler">Close Me!</$button>
