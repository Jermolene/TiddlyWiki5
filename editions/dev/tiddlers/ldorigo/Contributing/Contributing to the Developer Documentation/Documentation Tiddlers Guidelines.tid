type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
toc-order: 2
tags: [[Contributing to the Developer Documentation]]

The rules described here are similar to the ones on ~TiddlyWiki's Documentation for [[Instruction Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Instruction%20Tiddlers]] and [[Reference Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Reference%20Tiddlers]].

Most sections in this documentation are adressed to advanced users, and serve as reference. They should follow [[Reference Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Reference%20Tiddlers]] rules. 
The only exceptions are in the [[Contributing]] and [[Various How-To's]] sections, which can have more of a tutorial style, and can thus follow the rules prescribed for [[Instruction Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Instruction%20Tiddlers]].

Some extra rules/guidelines (these may eventually be split into their own tiddlers):

* Avoid missing tiddlers. 
* (Almost) all tiddlers should have a `toc-order` tag specifying what place they shouyld have in the section's table of contents. This will also allow `previous` and `next` buttons to be added in the future.
