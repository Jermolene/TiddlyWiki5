This section presents a set of guidelines and rules for contributions to TiddlyWiki's developer documentation. Most rules are copied/adapted from [[the main documentation|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Documentation%20Style%20Guide]].

The main structure of the documentation is more or less fixed as follows:

* ''Introduction'': Contains a broad description of TW's architecture, defines basic concepts. 
* ''High-Level overview'': Contains detailed but high level descriptions of the different components of the app
** ''Microkernel'': Description of the boot mechanisms and the microkernel
** ''Core Plugin''
** ''User Interface'': Description of the rendering process, both for tiddlers and for the general UI of the app
** ''Data Persistence'': Description of the various mechanisms for saving data
** ''Modules'': Description of the various modules. 
** ''Hooks''
* ''Detailed Documentation'': Will contain a code-level description/explanation of the various parts of the app. 
* ''Contributing'': Contains all the information relevant to people who want to contribute to TW, including:
** Setting up the development environment
** Style guides
** Documentation style guides
** Tests
** ...
* ''Various How-To's'': General tutorials that don't fit elsewhere in the documentation.

Feel free to add more sub-sections to the existing ones. 

Each (sub-)section should contain a tiddler with the same name that briefly describes what the section is about and contains a table of contents for the section. TODO: Make a macro for this?
