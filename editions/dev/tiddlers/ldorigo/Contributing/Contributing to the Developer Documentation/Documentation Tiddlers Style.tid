The rules described here are similar to the ones on TiddlyWiki's Documentation for [[Instruction Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Instruction%20Tiddlers]] and [[Reference Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Reference%20Tiddlers]].

Most sections in this documentation are adressed to advanced users, and serve as reference. They should follow [[Reference Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Reference%20Tiddlers]] rules. 
The only exceptions are in the [[Contributing]] and [[Various How-To's]] sections, which can have more of a tutorial style, and can thus follow the rules prescribed for [[Instruction Tiddlers|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Instruction%20Tiddlers]].
