title: Notifier utility
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Overview

The notifier module is part of tiddlywiki's utils suite. It displays the text contained on one as notification. 
Notifications are an easy and visual mechanism to notify the user about key information. 
Notifications appear on the right top border of the screen, and are automatically dismissed.
One usage example is the `saved wiki` notification you see each time the save button is clicked.
The notification module makes easier to display such notifcations, making all the heavy lifting of the notifcation creation
,appending it to the `DOM`, animation and `DOM` removal

!! Parameters

The notifier module only has one method (`display(title,options)`) that accepts two parameters

* title: The title of an existing tiddler. 
** If the tiddler does not exist, then no notification will take place
** The content of this tiddler will be transcluded into the notification body
* Options: An object conaining a `variables` property that will be used on the tiddler transclusion

!! Usage

A notifier instance is availably directly on the global `$tw` object. You can access it directly on any part of your code that 
may need to notify something to the user

```js
$tw.notifier.display("$:/language/Notifications/Save/Starting");
```
