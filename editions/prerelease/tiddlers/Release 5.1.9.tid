//[[See GitHub for detailed change history of this release|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/compare/v5.1.8...v5.1.9]]//

! Major Improvements

!! New "Fluid story, fixed sidebar" mode

It is now possible to arrange the main window so that the sidebar has a fixed width and the story river expands to fill the remaining space.

To switch it on, visit ''Theme Tweaks'' in the $:/ControlPanel ''Appearance'' tab and use the following options:

* Sidebar layout:
** ''Fixed story, fluid sidebar'' (default) - the story river has a fixed width and the sidebar fills the remaining space
** ''Fluid story, fixed sidebar'' - the story river expands to fill horizontal space remaining after the fixed width sidebar
* Sidebar width:
** The width of the sidebar. Can be specified in pixels (eg ''350px''), a percentage (eg ''25%'') or other [[CSS unit|https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/length]]

!! New Tiddler Toolbar Button: "Open in new window"

An experimental new tiddler toolbar button opens a single tiddler in a separate pop-up browser window. The tiddler will be dynamically updated just as in the main window. There are several uses:

* Arranging reference tiddlers for easy access while editing in the main window
* Making good use of multi-screen layouts
* Printing the content of a single tiddler
* Running presentations in a separate window while maintaining notes in the main window

!! Improvements for visually impaired users

* Improved monochrome palette variants:
** <$button>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/theme" text="$:/themes/tiddlywiki/vanilla"/>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/palette" text="$:/palettes/ContrastDark"/>
Dark palette
</$button>. Foreground: <<colour-picker "$:/palettes/ContrastDark" "foreground">>, Background: <<colour-picker "$:/palettes/ContrastDark" "background">>
** <$button>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/theme" text="$:/themes/tiddlywiki/vanilla"/>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/palette" text="$:/palettes/ContrastLight"/>
Light palette
</$button>. Foreground: <<colour-picker "$:/palettes/ContrastLight" "foreground">>, Background: <<colour-picker "$:/palettes/ContrastLight" "background">>
** <$button>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/theme" text="$:/themes/tiddlywiki/snowwhite"/>
<$action-setfield $tiddler="$:/palette" text="$:/palettes/Vanilla"/>
Revert
</$button>

!! Options for Story Control

There are new options for controlling the position in the story river of newly opened tiddles. Visit the ''Settings'' tab of $:/ControlPanel and look for "Tiddler Opening Behaviour".

!! New Setting for Draft Tiddler Typing Timeout

TiddlyWiki defers processing changes to draft tiddlers until a timeout has elapsed. The default value of 400ms gives a good balance of responsiveness in most cases but isn't always optimal on lower powered mobile devices.

The timeout can now be changed by changing the value in [[$:/config/Drafts/TypingTimeout]].
