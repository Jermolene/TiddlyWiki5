title: Improving TiddlyWiki Documentation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Anyone can submit improvements to the TiddlyWiki documentation on http://tiddlywiki.com. Please start by reading the [[Documentation Style Guide]].

You can submit changes in two ways:

# The much preferred method is to use GitHub as detailed below.
# Alternatively, send modifications and content proposals to the [[TiddlyWikiDocs discussion group|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tiddlywikidocs]].

! Github method

# Create an account on http://github.com if you don't already have one.
# Before your first contribution, read [[Signing the Contributor License Agreement]], then sign the [[CLA|Contributor License Agreement]].
# On http://tiddlywiki.com, click {{$:/core/ui/Buttons/edit}}''edit'' on the tiddler you want to improve.
#* You can test your modifications here directly and review the results.
# During editing, you should see the following pink banner: <$transclude tiddler="$:/ContributionBanner" mode="block"/>
# Click on the external link [[this tiddler on GitHub|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/edit/master/editions/tw5.com/tiddlers/community/Improving%20TiddlyWiki%20Documentation.tid]].
#* You will be prompted that: "You need to fork this repository to propose changes."
#* A "fork" is your own copy of the repository that incorporates the changes you are proposing.
# A new browser tab will open on GitHub with an editor for the tiddler.
# Below the editor you will find a box labelled ''Propose file change''.
# Enter a brief title to explain the change (eg, "fixed typo").
#* For more comprehensive changes or your reasons for modifications, use the long description.
# Click the green button labelled ''Propose file change''.
# On the next screen, click the green button labelled ''Create pull request''.

[[Jermolene|https://github.com/Jermolene]] or one of the other core developers will then have the opportunity to merge your pull request so that it is incorporated into the next build of http://tiddlywiki.com.
