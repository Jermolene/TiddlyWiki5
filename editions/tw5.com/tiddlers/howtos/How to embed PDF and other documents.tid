title: How to embed PDF and other documents
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Two ways to embed a PDF in your TW5 file.

''Note:'' Before embedding files in TiddlyWiki, you may want to consider instead simply linking to the external resource like this:

```
[ext[title|path/to/that.file]] 
```

Then let your browser decide how to handle the resource. The advantage to this approach is that it is simple and quick. The disadvantage is that the file doesn't actually travel with the TW5 file and that you can't use `node.js` with method #2 below to quickly file paths.

!!! 1. Embedding with Drag and Drop 

Drag and drop the file onto your TiddlyWiki or use other methods to [[import external files|Importing Tiddlers]]. 

This method is not recommended for larger files because they add to the total size and load time for your TiddlyWiki file.

''Note:'' Some browsers, most notably IE/Edge can have problems to display embedded PDF files.

!!! 2. Embedding with '_canonical_uri'

This method doesn't actually incorporate the file into your TiddlyWiki but instead links to it.

Create a tiddler with a field named `_canonical_uri`. For field value add the the address to the external file. Set the `type` field to `application/pdf`.

The location address of the file can also be changed under [[node.js]]. See [[ExternalImages]] for details of using external images with node.js.

!!! Other File Types

TiddlyWiki only supports a limited set of [[file formats|ContentType]]. If your browser and/or TW5 doesn't know what to do with a particular file format, then you can only the use the second method to embed and then download a file. When you edit the tiddler a link is presented. You can right click on the link in order to download the file.
