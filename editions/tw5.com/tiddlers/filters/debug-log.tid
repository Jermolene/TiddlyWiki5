<<.from-version "5.2.6">>

The <<.op debug-log>> operator can be used to output debugging information to the JavaScript console supported by most browsers. This can be useful because otherwise it is difficult to observe what is going on inside a filter run. The operator logs its input at the current position within the filter expression and therefore can be sensible to use in multiple places, e.g. to compare the input and output of another operator.

<<.op debug-log>> also logs empty tiddler titles in its input list.

At the end of debugging, all <<.op debug-log>> operators should be removed from the filter expression, in order not to flood the console window with unneeded data.
