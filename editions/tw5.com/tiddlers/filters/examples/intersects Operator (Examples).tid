title: intersects Operator (Examples)
tags: [[intersects Operator]] [[Operator Examples]]

Note: The first example is very similar to the [[tag operator|tag Operator]]. The differences are that it isn't limited to just the tag field and that you can check multiple operands at the same time.

<<.operator-example 1 "[intersects[usage]]" "Tiddlers that have usage listed in their list field">>
<<.operator-example 2 "[intersects[usage docs]]" "Tiddlers that have either readme or usage or both listed in their list field">>
