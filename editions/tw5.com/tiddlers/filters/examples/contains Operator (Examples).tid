Note: The first example can be done using the [[listed operator|listed Operator]], the second example shows one way this operater differs from listed.
The large conceptual difference between this operator and listed is that listed tests all tiddlers against an input list of contents, this tests an input list of tiddlers against a given list of contents.

<<.operator-example 1 "[contains[readme]]" "Tiddlers that have readme listed in their list field">>
<<.operator-example 2 "[contains[readme usage]]" "Tiddlers that have both readme and usage listed in their list field">>
