caption: field
purpose: filter the input by field

<$macrocall $name=".operator-def"
input="a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]"
suffix="the name of a [[field|TiddlerFields]]"
suffixName="f"
parameter="a possible value of field <<.place f>>"
paramName="s"
output="those input tiddlers in which field <<.place f>> has the value <<.place s>>"
negationOutput="those input tiddlers in which field <<.place f>> does <<.em not>> have the value <<.place s>>"
/>

If <<.place s>> is empty, <<.op field>> will match both of the following:

* tiddlers that don't contain field <<.place f>>
* tiddlers in which field <<.place f>> exists but has an empty value

The syntax of a [[filter step|Filter Step]] treats any unrecognised [[filter operator|Filter Operators]] as if it was the suffix to the <<.op field>> operator. See the <<.operator-examples "field" "examples">>.
