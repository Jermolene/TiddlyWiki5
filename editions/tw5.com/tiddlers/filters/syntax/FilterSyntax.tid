title: Filter Syntax
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Filter expressions|Filters]] follow a grammar that is presented here, using [[RailroadDiagrams]], for those who find formal syntax descriptions helpful. However, you can write your own filter expressions without needing to understand this tiddler.

;filter
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/filter}}

A sequence of runs is evaluated from left to right, as follows:

|!Sequence |!Interpretation |
|`run1 run2` |union of the sets, i.e. the tiddlers in //either// run1 //or// run2 |
|`run1 -run2` |difference of the sets, i.e. run1 but excluding any tiddlers in run2 |
|`run1 +run2` |run2 takes run1 as its input |

The first run takes `[all[tiddlers]]` as its input, i.e. the set of all non-missing tiddlers.

;run
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/run}}
* The last three options are short for `[title[text]]`
* A run evaluates each of its steps and returns the intersection of the results

---

;step
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/step}}
* A step returns a set of tiddlers, in the form of a TitleList

---

;operator
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/operator}}
* Keywords are reserved names (<code>[[is|FilterOperator: is]]</code>, <code>[[has|FilterOperator: has]]</code>, <code>[[tag|FilterOperator: tag]]</code>, etc) of specific filtering functions
* A fieldname on its own implies the keyword `field`
* An entirely omitted operator defaults to `title`

---

;parameter
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/parameter}}
* `[`...`]` encloses a literal parameter
* `{`...`}` encloses a TextReference parameter
* `<`...`>` encloses a [[variable|Variables]] parameter

---

;whitespace
: {{$:/editions/tw5.com/FilterSyntax/whitespace}}
* A match for the JavaScript regular expression `\s+`
