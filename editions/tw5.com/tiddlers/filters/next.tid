title: next Operator
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki
caption: next
purpose: find which titles in a <<.field list>> field follow the input ones

<$macrocall $name=".operator-def"
input="a [[selection of titles|Title Selection]]"
parameter="a tiddler title"
paramName="t"
output="a selection containing each title that immediately follows each of the input titles in the <<.field list>> field of <<.place t>>"
/>

Each input title is processed in turn, and its successor is located in the <<.field list>> field and appended to the output. If a title is not listed in the field, or is the last title there, then it contributes nothing to the output.
