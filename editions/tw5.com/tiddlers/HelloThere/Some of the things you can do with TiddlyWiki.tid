* Take notes, and use tags and hyperlinking to form relationships between your notes
* Use tabs, tables, tag-based lists, and tables of contents to get organzed
* Bookmark your favorite websites (see an example at http://giffmex.org/experiments/tidmarks.html)
* Keep track of tasks and appointments, and organize them by multiple tags (see our TaskManagementExample)
* Inventory just about anything: your recipes, personal library, contacts, music collection, and more
* Create a blog or website
* Write a book
* Organize your images into galleries (see our [[ImageGallery Example]])
* Share the information in your ~TiddlyWiki with others, as an online file, as a file attachment, as a tiddler file, or as a link to a specific online tiddler (try clicking and dragging a tiddler from one ~TiddlyWiki file to another to see what happens)
* Draw a sketch (Edit [[Motovun Jack.jpg]] and start drawing over the image to see what happens)
* Create a modal wizard (also known as a lightbox) - see SampleWizard
* Create a slideshow presentation
* Set up an entire local or online knowledgebase, with a central ~TiddlyWiki file linking to other ~TiddlyWiki files (http://recursos.giffmex.org is a Spanish online example of this)
* Set up a data visualization using tiddlers as data (see the visualizations at http://tiddlywiki.com/d3demo.html)
* Create a timeline (See http://emkayonline.github.io/tw5visjs/#ShowTimelineDemo)
