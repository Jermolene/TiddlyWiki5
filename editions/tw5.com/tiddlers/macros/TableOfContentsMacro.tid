title: TableOfContentsMacro
tags: macros
modified: 20140828080307785

The table of contents macro produces a hierarchical tree of tiddlers based on their tags.

The top level entries of the table of contents are defined by a root tag. The subentries under each of those entries are tagged with the title of the entry. Entries can be ordered using the `list` field as described in TiddlerTags. The text for each entry is taken from the ''caption'' field if it is present, otherwise the ''title'' is used.

There are several variants of the macro:

* `<<toc>>` produces a simple hierarchical tree of links
* `<<toc-expandable>>` produces an expandable tree of links
* `<<toc-selective-expandable>>` produces an expandable tree of links where the expand/contract buttons are only shown for entries that possess child nodes

! Parameters

|!Position |!Name |!Description |!Default |
|1st |tag |The root tag that identifies the top level of the hierarchy | |
|2nd |sort |Optional sorting subfilter (eg `sort[title]`) | |

The ''tag'' and ''sort'' parameters are combined to make a filter expression of the form:

```
[tag[$tag$]$sort$]
```
