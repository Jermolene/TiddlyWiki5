!! Language plugins

You can directly pass title to `lingo` macro, when there is a language plugin containing a tiddler with such title that start with `$:/language/`.

!! Plugins

When writing a plugin, you can place translatable text in tiddlers under the `$:/plugins/xxx/yyy/languages/` path of your plugin. During wiki boot they are automatically moved to `$:/plugins/xxx/yyy/language/` path, so lingo macro can use `$:/plugins/xxx/yyy/language/` as base path to get the translation.

!! Parameters

;key
: The last part of title of the tiddler that contains the text. The `<<lingo-base>>` prefix and current language name prefix is added automatically
