title: Installing TiddlyWiki on Node.js
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!! Installing Node.js

# Install [[Node.js]] from http://nodejs.org
# Open a command line terminal and type:
#> `npm install -g tiddlywiki`
#> If it fails with an error you may need to re-run the command as an administrator:
#> `sudo npm install -g tiddlywiki` (Mac/Linux)
# Check TiddlyWiki is installed by typing:
#> `tiddlywiki --version`
# In response, you should see TiddlyWiki report its current version (eg "<<version>>"; you may also see other debugging information reported)

If you are using Debian or Debian-based Linux and you are receiving a `node: command not found` error though node.js package is installed, you may need to create a symbolic link between `nodejs` and `node`. Consult your distro's manual and `whereis` to correctly create a link. See github [[issue 1434|http://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/issues/1434]]

Example Debian v8.0: `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`

!! Installing the server-related empty edition:
# Open the commandline and navigate to the directory where you want to create the wiki folder
# `tiddlywiki mynewwiki --init server` this will create a folder for a new wiki that includes server-related components
# `tiddlywiki mynewwiki --server` to start TiddlyWiki
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser
# Try editing and creating tiddlers
The purpose of this edition is that this wiki should now auto-save the changes.

!! Installing other editions (without server-related components included):
In the case where one would need to install another edition (like for contributing to the code or to the docs or to start a new wiki translated in another language)

# `tiddlywiki mynewwiki --init version_to_use`
#* To find help on this command: `tiddlywiki --help init`
# Replace the `version_to_use` by one of the edition provided by this command:<br />`tiddlywiki --editions`
#* Example:<br />`tiddlywiki mynewwiki --init tw5.com`<br /><br />
# `tiddlywiki mynewwiki --server` to start your new TiddlyWiki
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser
# Try editing and creating tiddlers

!! How to add server-related components to an existing wiki

# After installing a new TiddlyWiki with the commands above
# Edit the `tiddlywiki.info` file present in the new wiki folder:<br /><br />
## In the `plugins` section, add those lines:
#> `"tiddlywiki/tiddlyweb",
"tiddlywiki/filesystem",`
# If opened: save the wiki then exit the process in the terminal and re-launch it in order for this to take effect.<br /><br />
# To check if the modifications are functionnals:
#> Once you have re-launched your wiki, check for the presence of the two plugins in the control panel, make sure they are not disabled.
#>And / or
#> Check for scrolling text in the opened terminal, under: <br />`Serving on 127.0.0.1:8080`
This wiki should now auto-save changes.

<<.warning "With Node.js server-related plugins you add via the plugin library are not persisted across page refreshes. To make it permanent you have to edit the tiddlywiki.info file.">>
