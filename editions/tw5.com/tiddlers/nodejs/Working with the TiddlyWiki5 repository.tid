! Introduction

If you want to [[contribute|Contributing]] to TiddlyWiki's development, rather than [[installing TiddlyWiki in the usual way|Installing TiddlyWiki on Node.js]], you can work directly with the GitHub repository. 

Mario Pietsch has created a [[short video introduction|Working with the TiddlyWiki5 repository video]].

! Setting Up

# Create an account on GitHub if you don't already have one
# Fork the TiddlyWiki5 GitHub repository from https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5
# Clone a local copy of your fork
# Open a command line terminal and change the current working directory to the root of the repo
# Type `npm link` (Windows) or `sudo npm link` (Mac/Linux) to tell [[npm]] to use this copy of the repo as the globally installed one

After this procedure you can work with TiddlyWiki5 via [[npm]] as though it were installed in the usual way with `npm install -g tiddlywiki`.

''Note:'' You do ''not'' run TiddlyWiki from the root of the TiddlyWiki5 repo. Instead you can either run one of the editions in the repo or else use `tiddlywiki --init` in another directory to create a wiki for testing.
