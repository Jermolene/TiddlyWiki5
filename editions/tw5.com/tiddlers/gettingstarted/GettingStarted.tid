~TiddlyWiki comes in 2 major flavors

* ''Single HTML file flavor'': All your notes/tiddlers are saved in a single HTML file. You can view, search and navigate your wiki using any web browser.
* ''Node.js based flat file flavor'': All your notes/tiddlers are saved as separate text files. Node.js runtime is required to view your wiki in browser.
<<.tipw "You can convert your wiki between the two flavors any time.">>
<<.tipw "There are third-party community resources providing other back-ends like [[sqlite, boltdb, dynamodb |Widdly by Opennota]] and [[PouchDB|Noteself by Danielo RodrÃ­guez]]. Please note that they are published and maintained independently of TW5">>
