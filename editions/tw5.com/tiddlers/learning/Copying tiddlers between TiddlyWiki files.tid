title: Copying tiddlers between TiddlyWiki files
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

You can copy an individual tiddler from one TiddlyWiki file to another by dragging a link to the tiddler from one browser window to another.

Depending on your browser dragging may not work, moving the mouse only highlights the text. In this case you should hold down the left mouse on the link's text, wait a second, then try to drag it again.
