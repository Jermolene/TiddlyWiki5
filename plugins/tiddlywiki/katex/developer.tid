!! How to upgrade

# Download latest release zip file from [[Github release|https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases]]
# backup the old `plugins/tiddlywiki/katex/files/tiddlywiki.files` file
# rename extracted folder to "files" and copy it to `plugins/tiddlywiki/katex/files` (maybe delete the old folder first, to make a full overwrite).
# create `plugins/tiddlywiki/katex/files/tiddlywiki.files` (or use the old one) and register all files in it.
