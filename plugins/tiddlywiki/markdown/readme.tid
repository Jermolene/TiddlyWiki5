title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown/readme

This plugin provides Markdown support via the [[markdown-it|https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it]] parser and its associated plugins:

* markdown-it-deflist
* markdown-it-footnote
* markdown-it-ins
* markdown-it-mark
* markdown-it-sub
* markdown-it-sup

!! Compatibility Notes

* A tab character in Markdown has a size of four spaces. Configure the tab size of your code editor accordingly. For example, if you use <$text text="CodeMirror"/>, it is recommended that you set $:/config/codemirror/indentUnit and $:/config/codemirror/tabSize to `4` to avoid inconsistent indentations.
* You must terminate a table with a blank line or another block-level structure.
