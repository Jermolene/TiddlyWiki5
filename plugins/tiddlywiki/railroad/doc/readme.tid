This plugin provides a `<$railroad>` widget for generating railroad syntax diagrams as SVG images. It is based on [[a library by Tab Atkins|https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams]].

The widget processes its content as ordinary ~WikiText, allowing transclusions to occur in the normal way. However, it then treats the resulting string as a nest of ~JavaScript calls to construct a diagram.
