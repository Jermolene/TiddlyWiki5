This plugin provides a `<$railroad>` widget for generating railroad syntax diagrams as SVG images. It is based on [[a library by Tab Atkins|https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams]].

The content of the `<$railroad>` widget is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|text |Text in a special syntax that defines the diagram's layout |
|mode |If set to `debug`, the diagram will display its internal tree structure. The default mode is `svg` |

The `text` can be transcluded from another tiddler:

```
<$railroad tiddler={{diagram}}>
```
