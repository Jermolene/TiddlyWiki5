This plugin provides syntax highlighting of code blocks using v8.8.0 of [[highlight.js|https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js]] from Ivan Sagalaev.

! Usage

When the plugin is installed it automatically applies highlighting to all codeblocks defined with triple backticks or with the CodeBlockWidget.

The language can optionally be specified after the opening triple braces:

<$codeblock code="""```css
 * { margin: 0; padding: 0; } /* micro reset */

html { font-size: 62.5%; }
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; } /* =14px */
h1   { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; } /* =24px */
```"""/>

If no language is specified highlight.js will attempt to automatically detect the language.

! Built-in Language Brushes

The plugin includes support for the following languages (referred to as "brushes" by highlight.js):

* apache
* bash
* coffeescript
* cpp
* cs
* css
* diff
* http
* ini
* java
* javascript
* json
* makefile
* markdown
* nginx
* objectivec
* perl
* php
* python
* ruby
* sql
* xml

You can also specify the language as a MIME content type (eg `text/html` or `text/css`). The mapping is accomplished via mapping tiddlers whose titles start with `$:/config/HighlightPlugin/TypeMappings/`.

! Supporting Additional Languages

The [[highlight.js|https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js]] project supports many languages. Only a subset of these languages are supported by the plugin. It is possible for users to change the set of languages supported by the plugin by following these steps:

# Go to the highlight.js project [[download page|https://highlightjs.org/download/]], select the language definitions to include, and press the Download button to download a zip archive containing customised support files for a highlight.js syntax highlighting server
# Locate the `highlight.pack.js` file in the highlight plugin -- on a stock Debian 8 system running Tiddlywiki5 under node-js it is located at `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/tiddlywiki/plugins/tiddlywiki/highlight/files/highlight.pack.js`
# Replace the plugin `highlight.pack.js` file located in step 2 with the one from the downloaded archive obtained in step 1
# Restart the TW5 server
