! Documentation

The components of this plugin include:

* A background task that:
** performs specified actions when elements are scrolled into view
** updates certain base classes on the `document.body` according to the current zoom level
** if enabled in the dynaview config panel - dynamically stores the viewport dimensions in $:/state/viewport/width and $:/state/viewport/height
* Pre-configured CSS classes to simplify using those base classes
* Usage examples

! Scroll Features

The background task detects when elements with the class `tc-dynaview-set-tiddler-when-visible` scroll into view. The first time that they do, the background task assigns the value in the attribute `data-dynaview-set-value` to the tiddler whose title is in the attribute `data-dynaview-set-tiddler`. This assignment can be tied to a reveal widget to cause content to be displayed when it becomes visible. If the class `tc-dynaview-expand-viewport` is set then the viewport is expanded so that the processing occurs when elements move near the viewport.
